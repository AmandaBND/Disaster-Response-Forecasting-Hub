# Disaster-Response-Forecasting-Hub
The Disaster Resilience Hub is a unified React web application that uses Gemini AI for intelligence and Google Firestore for real-time coordination. Its primary goal is to improve information flow and coordination during and after natural disasters, focusing on flood recovery.

# Key Functional Modules

1. AI Query Agent (Intelligence): Provides accurate, real-time, and sourced answers to public questions about disaster status (roads, water levels) using Gemini 2.5 Flash with Google Search Grounding.

2. Real-Time Water Level Monitoring: Tracks simulated water levels for key rivers against Minor and Major Flood thresholds, visualized on a Bar Chart for rapid risk assessment.

3. Public Health Outbreak Forecasting: A scenario tool that predicts potential post-disaster disease cases and necessary resources (medical kits/staff) based on climate factors (rainfall/temperature). Data is displayed on a Dual-Axis Bar Chart.

4. Reconstruction and Aid Portal (Coordination): A public registry powered by Google Firestore that allows users to list damaged properties and aid needs, streamlining connection between victims, donors, and reconstruction teams in real-time.
